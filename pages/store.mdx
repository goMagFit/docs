## Create a checkout session
Creating a checkout session is Stripes way of making a personal and secure checkout for your customer, making is easy for you to recieve payments directly to your bank account. 

For MoreGyms there are three ways that you can create a checkout session on: `Your dashboard`, `MoreGyms.com`, or `the MoreGyms app`.

#### Checkout session on your dashboard
If a customer doesn't want to go on MoreGyms.com or download the MoreGyms mobile app, you can create a cart from them directly within your dashboard. 

In order to create a checkout session, you need make sure that you have your [items](/#store-items) and [memberships](/#memberships) added correctly.

Once your [items](/#store-items) and [memberships](/#memberships) added correctly, you can add the items and memberships to your cart by clicking the `Add to Cart` button located next to each item and membership.

After you have added the desired products, click on the `Cart` button on the top right of the [Store page](https://dashboard.moregyms.com/store) in the your [owner dashboard](https://dashboard.moregyms.com/store). By clicking the `Cart` button, it will open a pop up of your cart with two buttons: `Close` and `Checkout`. To close the cart and continue shopping click `Close`. To procceed to checkout click `Checkout`.

Clicking `Checkout` will generate a QR code that is scannable from any device with a working camera and connection to internet. Once you scan the QR code you will be redirected to a secure Stripe Checkout Page. On this page, the user can input their credit card information to complete the transaction.

Upon completion, you will see the reflected amount directly in your Stripe Connect account. For more questions regarding checkout sessions from your dashboard please reach out to us at hello@moregyms.com.
#### Checkout session on MoreGyms.com
If you have a customer who is trying to purchase items or a membership from your store, but doesn't want to download the app, they can directly purchase items from your page store.

Once on your store page, customers can browse your products and add them to their cart. In order for customers to add items to their cart they must have a free MoreGyms account.

After the user is done with adding to their cart, they need to click the `Cart` button located at the top right of your store page.

Within the cart, the user will be able to see the items they added. In order to proceed with the purchase the user must click `Continue to Checkout`. Once the user clicks `Continue to Checkout`, they will be redirected to a secure and slick Stripe checkout page.

On the checkout page, the user will be able to pay with `Apple Pay`, `Google Pay`, `Debit`, or `Credit`. Once all the proper information is collected and the payment is processed successfully, the user will be redirected to `https://moregyms.com/success?Success-ID`
