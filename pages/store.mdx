## Create a checkout session
Creating a checkout session is Stripes' way of making a personal and secure checkout for your customer. This way makes it easy for you to receive payments directly to your bank account. 

For MoreGyms, there are three ways that you can create a checkout session: `Your dashboard`, `MoreGyms.com`, or `the MoreGyms app`.

#### Checkout session on your dashboard
If a customer doesn't want to go on MoreGyms.com or download the MoreGyms mobile app, you can create a cart for them directly within your dashboard. 

In order to create a checkout session, you need make sure that you have your [items](/#store-items) and [memberships](/#memberships) added correctly.

Once your [items](/#store-items) and [memberships](/#memberships) are added correctly, you can add the items and memberships to your cart by clicking the `Add to Cart` button located next to each item and membership.

After you have added the desired products, click on the `Cart` button on the top right of the [Store page](https://dashboard.moregyms.com/store), in your [owner dashboard](https://dashboard.moregyms.com/store). By clicking the `Cart` button, it will open a pop-up of your cart with two buttons: `Close` and `Checkout`. To close the cart and continue shopping click `Close`. To proceed to checkout click `Checkout`.

Clicking `Checkout` will generate a QR code that is scannable from any device with a working camera and internet connection. Once you scan the QR code, you will be redirected to a secure Stripe checkout page. On this page, the user inputs their payment information to complete the transaction.

Upon completion, you will see the reflected amount directly in your Stripe Connect account. If you have questions regarding checkout sessions please reach out to us at hello@moregyms.com.
#### Checkout session on MoreGyms.com
If you have a customer who is trying to purchase items or membership from your store, but doesn't want to download the app, they can directly purchase items from your web profile.

Once on your store page, customers can browse your products and add them to their cart. For customers to add items to their cart, they must have a free MoreGyms account.

After the user is done with adding items to their cart, they need to click the `Cart` button located at the top right of your store page.

Within the cart, the user will be able to see the items they added. To proceed with the purchase the user must click `Continue to Checkout`. Once the user clicks `Continue to Checkout`, they will be redirected to a secure Stripe checkout page.

On the checkout page, the user will be able to pay with `Apple Pay`, `Google Pay`, `Debit`, or `Credit`. Once all the proper information is collected, and the payment is processed successfully, the user will be redirected to `https://moregyms.com/success?Success-ID`

#### Checkout session on the MoreGyms mobile app
The most efficient way for customers to purchase your store items is on the [MoreGyms app](https://moregyms.com/download). 

To access your store, users can search for your gym and click on your page. Once on your page, users need to click the `Gym Store` floating button. By clicking the `Gym Store` button the user will be navigated to your store.

On your store, users can add items to their cart or directly purchase items with a `Buy Now` button. Above the `Buy Now` button is a `Add to Cart` button that adds items to the cart.

To view the cart, users need to click the `Cart` button on the upper right-hand of the screen. Once on the cart page, users will see all their cart items along with a `Continue to Checkout` button.

## Successful Payments
There are two ways that you can check successful payments from your [MoreGyms Dashboard](https://dashboard.moregyms.com/store#payments):

| Where   | Benefit          |
| ----------- | ------------------------ |
| Payment tab on Store Page | Directly built within your dashboard|
| Stripe Connect Dashboard  | Straight from the source|

Either way, tracking your successful payments is an essential part of running your business. If you have any questions, or issues regarding successful payments email us at hello@moregyms.com.
