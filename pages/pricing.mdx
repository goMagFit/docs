#### MoreGyms Pro Plan
Our [Pro Plan](#moregyms-pro-plan) is simple, you pay `$97 /mo` and the processing fee goes away. The thought process on this, is we do not want to squeeze you of your profits. If we are taking more than `$97 /mo` from our basic plan, it would be cost-effective to switch over to the [Pro Plan](#moregyms-pro-plan).
